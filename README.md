### 📘 Overview

This repository hosts the official release of the white paper:

> **"Language Construct Modeling (LCM): A Language-Native Framework for Modular Semantic Control in LLMs"**

LCM introduces a novel modular semantic control system designed for use within large language models (LLMs). It provides a recursive framework for prompt structuring and regenerative semantic behavior using a layered approach built on **Meta Prompt Layering (MPL)**.

LCM does not require any internal modification to the language model.
All structural logic, modular composition, control recursion, and regenerative behavior are implemented through language itself — via prompt-based layering and semantic orchestration.

This framework is fully language-native, requiring no fine-tuning, no scripting, and no API calls. It demonstrates that a large language model can act as a modular reasoning system purely through structured prompt logic.

The system supports stable semantic loops, dynamic control modules, and regenerative prompt trees (RPTs), making it suitable for scalable, interpretable prompt-based reasoning in LLMs.
